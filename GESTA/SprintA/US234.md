# **1.4 Vision, Mission & Values – JadeWeserPort Wilhelmshaven**

---

## **1.4.1. Vision**

**Identified Vision:**
To become an outstanding example of economically viable and ecologically sustainable port infrastructure, evolving into a central hub for sustainable energy production with a focus on hydrogen and climate-friendly technologies in Germany's energy transition.

**Supporting Statements:**

> “The vision: a ‘green port’. We want our port to become an outstanding example of economically well thought-out and ecologically sustainable infrastructure.”
> *(Wirtschaftsförderungsgesellschaft Wilhelmshaven mbH | Port of Wilhelmshaven., n.d.)*

> “In the long term, the port is evolving into a hub for sustainable energy production, with a focus on hydrogen and climate-friendly technologies. This ensures Wilhelmshaven's position as an energy hub for Germany and transforms it into a key location for the energy transition.”
> *(Wilhelmshaven - Germany’s only deep-water port Niedersachsen Ports., n.d.)*

**Commentary:**
The idea of the “Green Port” is a strong and modern vision. It connects economic success with environmental responsibility, which fits perfectly with what is expected from global ports today. The focus on hydrogen and renewable energy makes it even more relevant for the future. I also think the vision is realistic — JadeWeserPort already has the infrastructure to back it up, since it is Germany’s only deep-water port with a water depth of 18 meters *(JadeWeserPort | Ship + Rail., n.d.)*.

## **1.4.2. Mission**

> “Germany’s only deep-water container terminal with a water depth of 18 metres is an important hub for the scheduled services of major shipping lines. Numerous container trains link the terminal with the main routes to destinations in Germany and other countries several times a week, ensuring that your goods and containers reach the customer quickly.”
> *(JadeWeserPort | Ship + Rail., n.d.)*

> “The signing of the agreement underlines the growing importance of JadeWeserPort as a central hub in international trade.”
> *(JadeWeserPort becomes a strategic hub for the world’s largest port in China | JadeWeserPort., n.d.)*

> “This project is not only enabling us to create new jobs, but is also strengthening Germany’s importance as a hub in the international movement of goods.”
> *(JadeWeserPort becomes a strategic hub for the world’s largest port in China | JadeWeserPort., n.d.)*

**Inferred Mission:**
JadeWeserPort’s mission is to provide efficient, reliable, and sustainable container logistics for the world’s largest vessels, strengthening Germany’s position as a global trade hub while promoting environmentally responsible port operations.

**Commentary:**
This mission feels practical and goal-oriented. It is about making logistics fast, reliable, and sustainable. The fact that they are positioning themselves as an international trade hub fits perfectly with their infrastructure and 24/7 operations. From a management point of view, the operational focus is smart because it connects economic performance with sustainability goals. While the vision is clearly articulated, JadeWeserPort lacks an explicitly stated mission statement, which would enhance strategic clarity and make the organization’s goals more transparent to external stakeholders.

## **1.4.3. Values**

> “To us, it goes without saying that economic, ecological and social aspects have to be considered each and every day till we find the right balance. That was true during the planning and construction of the port, and still holds good for operations today. We consistently do everything in our power to achieve these goals and often enough, we do more than is strictly necessary – to protect our natural resources, to promote the health of our staff and facilitate the lifelong learning process.”
> *(JadeWeserPort | Sustainability., n.d.)*

> “This award emphasises the port’s commitment to sustainable development and environmental protection.”
> *(JadeWeserPort Wilhelmshaven receives environmental management certification | JadeWeserPort., n.d.)*

**Identified Values:**

* **Sustainability:** *Seabin Project* – removes plastic and debris from the water
  *(JadeWeserPort - The Seabin Project - World Port Sustainability Program., n.d.)*
* **Innovation:** *Port Energy Consumption Management Tool* – helps monitor and lower energy use
  *(JadeWeserPort - Port Energy Consumption Management Tool - World Port Sustainability Program., n.d.)*
* **Safety:** *Emergency Notification System* – speeds up communication in emergencies
  *(JadeWeserPort - Emergency Notification System - World Port Sustainability Program., n.d.)*
* **Efficiency:** *Port Spot App* – improves operational transparency and coordination
  *(JadeWeserPort - “Port Spot” App - World Port Sustainability Program., n.d.)*

**Commentary:**
What is impressive is that JadeWeserPort really lives its values. It is not just slogans — there are actual projects behind them. The combination of sustainability, safety, efficiency, and innovation shows a strong internal culture that supports the “Green Port” idea. It also reflects that the port takes social responsibility seriously, not just environmental goals.

## **1.4.4. Coherence & Strategic Fit**

For JadeWeserPort, vision, mission, and values fit together really well. The message is consistent — sustainability is not just a side topic, it is at the center of everything. From a strategic management point of view, JadeWeserPort has a strong foundation that combines economic performance with sustainability. The port presents itself as a modern, responsible, and innovative logistics hub, which is exactly what is needed in today’s global supply chains and paves the way for long-term success.
